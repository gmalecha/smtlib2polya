 Usage
===============================================================================

  smtlib2polya requires Python 2.7 to run. It has been tested on Kubuntu and
  OSX; the timeout alarm may cause errors on Windows.

  Make sure that Polya is installed, and that the main directory is in the
  Python path. (You should be able to run "import polya" from the Python
  command line interpreter without error.) It is not necessary to install the
  optional computational geometry packages.

  Download the smtlib2polya directory. Edit batch_translate.py to point smt_dir
  to a directory containing .smt2 files.

  Execute "python batch_translate.py" from the command line. This will run
  Polya in order on all .smt2 files in smt_dir, and print results to
  smt_dir/results.out.
